# Hey! I’m guzesqdro — the mind behind this project 🥳

After 4 months of non-stop planning, testing, and hacking, I launched this platform to bring together everything I’ve learned, built, and tweaked — all in one place. 🚀

## 💡 What’s the goal?

To create a real tech community where knowledge is shared freely and curiosity is the driving force.  
I believe everyone should have access to powerful tools, apps, and ideas — no paywalls, no BS.

## 🔧 What do I do?

A bit of everything, for everyone:  
📱 Modded iOS apps (.ipa)  
🤖 Tweaked Android apps  
🍏 Custom macOS software  
💻 Unlocked Windows tools  
📦 A full repo for Sileo, Zebra, and Cydia  

Everything here is tested, clean, and ad-free. 🧼

## 🧠 Why?

Because I love learning, breaking things, fixing them better — and helping others skip the struggle.  
If you’re into tech, mods, and open-source vibes, you’re in the right place. 🤝
