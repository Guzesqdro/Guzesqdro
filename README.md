# Hey! I’m guzesqdro — the mind behind this project 🥳

After 4 months of non-stop planning, testing, and hacking, I launched this platform to bring together everything I’ve learned, built, and tweaked — all in one place. 🚀

## 💡 What’s the goal?

To create a real tech community where knowledge is shared freely and curiosity is the driving force.  
I believe everyone should have access to powerful tools, apps, and ideas — no paywalls, no BS.

## 🔧 What do I do?

A bit of everything, for everyone:  

- 📱 An Archive for **old repositories** of Cydia, Zebra and Sileo!
- 🍏 My own apps for Mac that **every user needs!**
- 💻 Creating **apps for others!**
- 🎁 Always **FREE!** 

Everything here is tested, clean, and ad-free. 🧼

## 🧠 Why?

Because I love learning, breaking things, fixing them better — and helping others skip the struggle.  
If you’re into tech, mods, and open-source vibes, you’re in the right place. 🤝
